title = About the Site
description = Info about the "Composer in WordPress site"
-->

This site had been created by [Andrey "Rarst" Savchenko](http://www.Rarst.net), who became Composer evangelist in WordPress circles after he got bitten by wild Composer in early 2013 (unconfirmed rumor).

He has been asked "but where can I read about all of that!?" few too many times and now this is it.

## Contact

This site's goal is to provide and point to any information you could possibly need about using Composer with WordPress projects.

So don't hesitate to contact with questions or suggestions!
