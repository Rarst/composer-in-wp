excerpt: Info about the “Composer in WordPress site”
---

This site had been created by [Andrey “Rarst” Savchenko](http://www.Rarst.net), who became Composer evangelist in WordPress circles after he got bitten by wild Composer in early 2013 (unconfirmed rumor).

He has been asked “but where can I read about all of that!?” few too many times and now this is it.
